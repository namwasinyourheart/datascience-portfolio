## PROJECTS
### Evaluating Risk for Loan Approvals [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102389548/235655723-c28f2ae0-5679-4462-b60e-98565995cef3.png)](https://github.com/namwasinyourheart/evaluating-risk-for-loan-approvals)

- Explored how multitask learning can be applied to some common NLP tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, and NER
- Performed exploratory data analysis on the CoNLL-2003 English dataset, experimented with various combinations of BiRNN to gain insights, compare, and analyze the results
- Utilized the public U.S airline sentiment dataset, scraped from Twitter for classifying tweets as positive, negative or neutral

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
